Taxes imposed by Chapter 13, or sections 2032A(c) or 2057(f)(2), of the Code will be apportioned against and paid by the recipient of the property to which such tax is attributable. If my personal representative elects to defer estate and inheritance taxes on certain property under section 6166 of the Code, such taxes will be apportioned against and paid by the recipient of such property. The recipient of property the gift of which caused gift tax to be paid will be treated as having received not only the gift property but also the amount of any gift tax included in my estate by section 2035(b) of the Code for purposes of apportionment. The benefit of a deduction, credit, reduction, or exemption under any provision of the Code (for instance, due to the marital or charitable deductions, the previously taxed property credit, the reduction in value under sections 2032A or 2057, a state or foreign death tax credit, a credit for gift taxes paid, the applicable credit amount (unified credit), or otherwise) will inure to the recipient of the property to which such benefit is attributable. The Executor may pay any taxes from the estate prior to recovering the attributable tax from the recipient of the property, or may subtract the attributable tax from such recipient’s share, as the Executor deems advisable. The term “death taxes” does not include any generationskipping transfer tax.'
